# Minesweeper
<h2> Welcome to Minesweeper C++ edition! </h2>

<h3>Here is a quick description to brush up your Minesweeper knowledge: </h3>
<p>
Minesweeper is single-player logic-based computer game played on rectangular board whose object is to locate a predetermined number of randomly-placed "mines" in the shortest possible time by clicking on "safe" squares while avoiding the squares with mines. If the player clicks on a mine, the game ends. Otherwise, a number between 0 and 8 is displayed that identifies the total number of mines present in the eight neighboring squares. Therefore, finding a square containing "8" indicated that all eight adjacent squares contain mines, while if a zero (displayed as a blank) is uncovered, there are no mines in the surrounding squares. A square suspected of containing a mine may be marked with flag.

<h3>Keep in mind that our C++ version has a few differences compared to the original:</h3>
<ul> 
<li>You won't be able to press the squares but instead will have to type in [command] [coordinate x] [coordinate y] in order to complete a turn</li>
<li>The only available commands are: mark, unmark, open</li>
<li>The game doesn't display the amount of the time it took you to complete it</li>
<li>You will have much more fun playing it</li>
</ul>
